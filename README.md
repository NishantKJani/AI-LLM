An interactive LLM based chatbot using Open-AI model GPT-3.5-turbo. Using ChainLit as webUI.
User can directly interact with OpenAI chatgpt via our own webUI similar to the one seen on OpenAI website. Utilizing the OpenAI API to perform integration and passing the requests along to OpenAI server for processing.

Current implementation is based of gpt-3.5-turbo. Moving forward can use other models as well.
